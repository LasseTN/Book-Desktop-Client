BookBuddy

BookBuddy is a library program for storing your books and the information about each book. It consists of a desktopapp for administration of books, genres, location and employees. The 
plan is to add a website where users can create a userprofile, where they can make their own lists of books (Books they have read, books they want to read and books they are currently reading). The 
user should update the book they are currently reading everytime they have read in their book, to the page they are at now. When the book is finished the user adds the book to Have read-list.
The user can add books in the DB to the three lists.

This program is a distributed system that consists of an API that holds CRUD funktionality for Books, Genre, Location, Employee, User and Log.
